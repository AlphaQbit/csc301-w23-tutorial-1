## Create your own pull request within this repository!

1. git clone this repo "git clone https://github.com/Daniel-Laufer/csc301-w23-tutorial-1"
2. create your own local branch with your name "git checkout -b firstname-lastname"
3. create a new text file "firstname-lastname.txt"

5. git add it and commit it
6. git push --set-upstream origin [name of your branch]
7. go to github and create a pull request from your branch to the master branch
merge changes. I'd recommend using a template for your pull request such as this one https://gist.github.com/jcserv/33f19818fde83c18e755b1c138eeac49#file-pull_request_template-md
