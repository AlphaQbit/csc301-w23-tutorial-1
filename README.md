# CSC301 Winter '23 Tutorial #1


## Pull Request Activitiy

1. Clone this repository "git clone https://github.com/Daniel-Laufer/csc301-w23-tutorial-1"
2. Create your own local branch with your name "git checkout -b firstname-lastname"
3. Create a new text file "firstname-lastname.txt"
4. Put whatever you want in it - "hello world"
5. Add it to your local git repo's staging area, then commit it.
6. git push --set-upstream origin [name of your branch]
7. go to github and create a pull request from your branch to the master branch
merge changes. I'd recommend using a template for your pull request such as this one https://gist.github.com/jcserv/33f19818fde83c18e755b1c138eeac49#file-pull_request_template-md

*note: this activity was originally done in Ethan Lam's CSC301 tutorial 1 during the winter 2022 semester.*
